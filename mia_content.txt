Abstract—Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct
private images from a target classifier’s training set, thereby
raising privacy concerns in AI applications. Previous GANbased MIAs tend to suffer from inferior generative fidelity due
to GAN’s inherent flaws and biased optimization within latent
space. To alleviate these issues, leveraging on diffusion models’
remarkable synthesis capabilities, we propose Diffusion-based
Model Inversion (Diff-MI) attacks. Specifically, we introduce
a novel target-specific conditional diffusion model (CDM) to
purposely approximate target classifier’s private distribution and
achieve superior accuracy-fidelity balance. Our method involves
a two-step learning paradigm. Step-1 incorporates the target
classifier into the entire CDM learning under a pretrain-thenfinetune fashion, with creating pseudo-labels as model conditions in pretraining and adjusting specified layers with image
predictions in fine-tuning. Step-2 presents an iterative image reconstruction method, further enhancing the attack performance
through a combination of diffusion priors and target knowledge.
Additionally, we propose an improved max-margin loss that
replaces the hard max with top-k maxes, fully leveraging feature
information and soft labels from the target classifier. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Diff-MI significantly improves
generative fidelity with an average decrease of 20% in FID while
maintaining competitive attack accuracy compared to state-ofthe-art methods across various datasets and models. Our code is

I. I NTRODUCTION
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are revolutionizing various
fields such as computer vision, autonomous driving, and
healthcare. However, these advancements have also raised
significant concerns regarding privacy attacks on DNNs. One
such category is Model Inversion Attacks (MIAs), which aim
to reconstruct private training samples by exploiting a “target
classifier”. In this paper, we focus on the white-box MIA
to reconstruct user images, in which case the attackers are
assumed to have full access to the target classifier.

Previous works [1]–[3] in the white-box setting have succeeded in reconstructing private images disclosing personal
information by using generative adversarial networks (GANs)
[4]. Firstly, they train the GAN on a public dataset to learn
an image prior that only shares structural similarity with the
private dataset (i.e., without any interclass overlap). Then
leveraging the full accessibility of the target classifier, they
continuously optimize latent variables through iterations until
they could reconstruct images with the highest confidence
associated with specific target labels in the target classifier. In
a word, their works can be summarized as a single-objective
optimization problem for the latent variables z, which are initially sampled from a Standard Gaussian distribution N (0, I),
by minimizing the classification loss between reconstructed
images and target labels.
Successful MIAs should balance both attack accuracy and
fidelity. However, these works using GANs as image priors
commonly suffer from inferior generative fidelity, which can
be attributed to the following two reasons. On the one hand,
GANs are difficult to train and prone to collapse without
carefully tuned hyper-parameters and regularizers [5]–[7],
inherently falling short in generative quality. On the other
hand, since GANs can be viewed as a mapping from a
known distribution (e.g., Standard Gaussian distribution) to a
complex image distribution [4], such an optimization strategy
can potentially distort the prior distribution in the latent space,
leading to fidelity degradation (see Fig. 1) in pursuit of higher
attack accuracy. Additionally, previous works have improved
the standard cross-entropy (CE) loss in MIAs for Poincaré loss
[8] and max-margin loss [3], whereas the feature information
and soft labels provided by the target classifier still remains
underutilized.
To address the above limitations, we propose a two-step
Diffusion-based Model Inversion (Diff-MI) attack, leveraging
on diffusion models (DMs)’ remarkable synthesis capabilities
[7], [11], [12]. Specifically, in step-1, we devise a targetspecific conditional diffusion model (CDM) to distill the target
classifier’s knowledge and approximate its private distribution.
Particularly, we first pretrain a CDM with public images along
with their pseudo-labels produced by the target classifier as
conditions. To fully distill the target classifier’s white-box
knowledge (e.g., gradients), we then fine-tune a small subset
of the pretrained CDM through its sampling process with
image predictions by the target classifier, achieving superior
accuracy-fidelity balance. In step-2, we introduce an iterative
image reconstruction method for diffusion-based MIAs to
mitigate the fidelity degradation problem. It turns the singleobjective optimization problem (i.e., minimizing the classifica-

with corresponding generated images, depicted with different colors (MIA Method = PLG-MI [3], Private Dataset = CelebA [9], Public
Dataset = CelebA, Target Classifier = Face.evoLVe [10]). Through iterations, we observe that the latent variables, initially sampled from
N (0, I), tend to cluster together and constitute a new distribution with a deviation from N (0, I). Meanwhile, reconstructed images gradually
deteriorate visually during inversion because of the widening gap between the optimized latent distribution and the prior distribution. As a
result, PLG-MI sacrifices generative fidelity for attack accuracy, which is also present in other GAN-based methods [1], [2].

further enhancing the attack performance. Additionally, we
propose an improved max-margin loss replacing the hard max
with top-k maxes along with a p-reg loss regularizing images
in the feature space, fully leveraging feature information and
soft labels from the target classifier. Our contributions can be
summarized as follows:

capabilities to solve MIA problem with high-fidelity reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the
first diffusion-based white-box MIA.

classifier’s private distribution, by creating pseudo-labels as

• We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our
Diff-MI achieves superior generative fidelity and reconstruction quality with competitive attack accuracy against stateof-the-art (SOTA) methods.

II. R ELATED W ORKS
MIAs were first proposed in [13], [14], where they demonstrated success in low-capacity models like logistic regression.
Recently, MIAs were extended to tackle more complex DNNs
and intended to acquire higher-dimensional private data (e.g.,
images). The first to launch MIAs against DNNs was Generative Model Inversion (GMI) [1], where the public dataset
was firstly extracted as an image prior by a GAN, and then
this prior was employed to guide the reconstruction of private
training samples with the guidance of the target classifier.
Knowledge-Enriched Distributional Model Inversion (KEDMI) [2] trained an inversion-specific GAN by introducing soft

labels produced by the target classifier and optimizes distributional estimation instead of point estimation in the latent space.
Variational Model Inversion (VMI) [15] proposed to view the
MIA problem as a variational inference problem, and provided
a framework using deep normalizing flows [16] regularized by
a KL divergence term. Plug & Play Attacks (PPA) [8] proposed
to use publicly available pretrained GANs to attack a wide
range of target models. Pseudo Label-Guided Model Inversion
(PLG-MI) [3] proposed to leverage pseudo-labels produced by
the target classifier to guide the training of a conditional GAN
[17] and achieved SOTA attack performance. However, above
GAN-based MIAs struggle to achieve a satisfactory balance
between attack accuracy and fidelity, either prioritizing high
accuracy at the expense of fidelity [1]–[3] or ensuring fidelity
at the cost of accuracy [8], [15]. Based on this limitation, our
goal is to achieve a superior accuracy-fidelity balance. More
recently, [18] introduced conditional diffusion models to tackle
black-box MIAs.
Diffusion Models [19] are probabilistic models designed
to learn an underlying data distribution and have recently
achieved impressive performance in image synthesis tasks,
such as conditional generation [7], [11], [12], image editing
[20]–[22], and text-to-image generation [23], [24]. These
models employ a Markov chain of diffusion steps, gradually
introducing random noise to the data and then learning to
reverse this diffusion process to generate desired data samples
from noise. To accomplish this, they train a time-conditioned
U-Net ϵθ (xt , t) [25] to predict a denoised variant of their
input xt , where xt is a noisy version of the input x0 . The
main objective can be simplified to

In this section, we first introduce the MIA problem and then
elaborate on the design details of the proposed Diffusion-based
Model Inversion (Diff-MI) attacks.

Fig. 2: Overview of our proposed two-step Diff-MI attacks. Step-1: We build a target-specific CDM on the public dataset to distill the
target classifier’s knowledge. This is achieved by pretraining a CDM with pseudo-labels produced by the target classifier as conditions, then
fine-tuning a small subset of the pretrained CDM with the guidance of the target classifier (subscripts of layers in the middle block indicate
their corresponding index). Step-2: We use an iterative image reconstruction method to involve both diffusion prior (i.e., Lprior ) and target
classifier’s knowledge (i.e., Lcls ). xT in step-1 and x0 in step-2 are both initialized from N (0, I).

A. MIA Problem
Problem Formulation. The goal of MIAs is to construct
an attack model, often termed the “attacker”, which is used
to reconstruct representative images associated with specified
“target labels” from the “private dataset” Dpri with only access
to the “target classifier” T . Take face recognition attacks
as an example, the attacker can reconstruct a facial image,
exposing the privacy of a target label yc (i.e., person ID)
by fully accessing a face recognition classifier. Typically, the
reconstructed image should visually and semantically resemble
the class-wise training samples of the target classifier.
Attacker’s Prior Knowledge. As our method deals with
the white-box MIAs, the attacker is granted access to all parameters of the target classifier. The attacker is also presumed
to know the data type (e.g., human face) of the private dataset.
Therefore, to familiarize the attacker with the private data type,
a “public dataset” Dpub of the same data type is utilized to gain
prior knowledge of general data features, sharing no interclass
overlap with Dpri .
B. Diffusion-based Model Inversion Attacks
An overview of our proposed Diff-MI is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Given a target classifier T trained on a private dataset Dpri ,
the attacker aims to reconstruct key features of identities in
Dpri with the support of a public dataset Dpub . Our Diff-MI
consists of two steps. In step-1, we build a target-specific CDM
to distill knowledge from the target classifier by pretraining a
CDM on Dpub with pseudo-labels as conditions and then finetuning a small subset of the pretrained CDM by incorporating
the target classifier through its sampling process. In step2, we propose an iterative image reconstruction method to

involve the diffusion prior and the target classifier’s knowledge
through a combinatorial optimization problem.
B.1 Step-1: Target-Specific Conditional Diffusion Model
Pre-training CDM. To leverage the knowledge of the target
classifier, we adopt a top-n selection strategy [3] in advance to
generate pseudo-labels for images in Dpub . Then we utilize the
obtained image-label pairs to pretrain the CDM. Specifically,
for a provided target classifier T and specified target label
yc ∈ {1, ..., C}, where C denotes the number of classes in
Dpri , we feed all public images into T and sort the ycth value
of logits (i.e., outputs of the last layer of T ) in descending
order. Then we select top-n public images with the highest
likelihood associated with yc .
This strategy aims to search for the most representative n
images in Dpub corresponding to every target label in Dpri .
Empirically, the target classifier has relatively high confidence
of class yc in the selected top-n images, which means these
images are perceived to share structural similarity with images
of the same class in Dpri from the perspective of T . In this way,
the image distribution can be decoupled into distinct classwise sub-distributions in advance, distilling the knowledge of
the target classifier into the CDM. Formally, for training the
CDM on Dpub with pseudo-labels yp ∈ {1, ..., C}, we have a
label-conditioned objective via Eq. 1, which now reads
h

LPretrain = Ex0 ,yp ,ϵ∼N (0,I),t ∥ϵ − ϵθ (xt , yp , t)∥2 .
(2)
Fine-tuning CDM. The use of pseudo-labels is effective in
distilling the knowledge of the target classifier. However, we
argue that the extracted target knowledge could be inadequate
for the attacker, especially when there is a significant gap
between the public and private datasets. This inadequacy may

arise because the pseudo-labels might not be as accurate as
anticipated due to the domain gap. Considering the whitebox knowledge of the target classifier (i.e., all parameters are
accessible), we propose to integrate the target classifier into the
CDM’s learning process to further extract its knowledge for
our target-specific CDM. In practice, we connect the target
classifier to the CDM and initiate a sampling process to
generate images. These generated images are then directly fed
into the target classifier for label prediction. By comparing
the predicted soft labels with the target labels, we can jointly
fine-tune the label embedding layer and the U-Net module of
the CDM using the following objective
LFine-tune = ExT ∼N (0,I),yc [Lcls (T (D (xT , yc )) , yc )] ,

(3)

where yc ∈ {1, ..., C} represents the target label, D (·, ·)
denotes the sampling process of the CDM, and Lcls is the
classification loss we will introduce in Sec. III-C.
The most straightforward way for fine-tuning is to adjust all
layers of the CDM during the sampling process. However, this
operation would undermine the learned mathematical properties of the CDM derived from the diffusion process (i.e., noiseadding process), leading to meaningless generations. Because
this contradicts the logic of diffusion models that predict
Gaussian noise. Our experiments reveal that only fine-tuning
the label embedding layer and the middle block of the U-Net
can result in higher attack accuracy but compromise slight
generative fidelity. To further minimize the impact on generative fidelity, we adopt the method from [26] to calculate the
change rate of layer’s parameters using ∆l = ∥θl′ − θl ∥ / ∥θl ∥,
where θl′ and θl denote the fine-tuned and original parameters
of layer l respectively. As demonstrated by [26], layers with
greater changes typically play a more significant role in finetuning. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), we empirically select five layers
in the middle block that show the highest ∆ during fine-tuning,
achieving superior accuracy-fidelity balance. Further analysis
is provided in Sec. IV-F.
B.2 Step-2: Iterative Image Reconstruction
Upon completing the training of our target-specific CDM,
the subsequent step is to employ it for reconstructing images
based on a specific target class. Instead of using the traditional
diffusion sampling process for image generation, we introduce
an iterative image reconstruction (IIR) method, inspired by
[27]. Particularly, IIR turns the diffusion sampling process
into a combinatorial optimization problem, which performs
image reconstruction by iterating differentiation involving both
the learned CDM prior and target classifier’s knowledge. This
enables the target classifier to further aid in guiding the image
reconstruction process.
Specifically, given a target label yc , we first initialize the
image x0 from N (0, I). Meanwhile, we define a time schedule
(ti )N
i=1 , where N represents the number of iterations, and t is
annealed from high to low values. To optimize x0 under the
trained target-specific CDM ϵθ and the constraint of the target
classifier T , we minimize the following objective consisting
of a prior loss Lprior and a classification loss Lcls :
LIIR = Lprior + Lcls (T (x0 ) , yc ) ,

(4)

where

Lprior = Eϵ∼N (0,I),ti ∥ϵ − ϵθ (xti , yc , ti )∥2 ,

(5)

√
√
ᾱti x0 + 1 − ᾱti ϵ represents the diffusion
and xti =
process of DMs according to a predefined schedule ᾱt .
Intuitively, the prior loss Lprior measures how well the
reconstructed image x0 aligns with the class-wise diffusion
prior. The classification loss Lcls evaluates the discrepancy
between the reconstructed image x0 and the target label yc
according to the target classifier T . After iterating N times,
we can obtain the reconstructed image x0 correlated with the
target label yc . Additionally, we adopt the targeted Projected
Gradient Descent (PGD) method [28]–[30] to improve the
reconstruction after IIR with the target classifier.

C. An Improved Max-Margin Loss
Previous works [1], [2], [15] have commonly adopted the
cross-entropy loss for classification while they are usually
confronting the vanishing gradient problem. This problem has
been proven and addressed by introducing novel losses such
as Poincaré loss [8], max-margin loss [3], and identity loss
[31], among which the max-margin loss achieves SOTA attack
performance:
LMM (x, yc ) = −lyc (x) + max lj (x),
j̸=yc

(6)

where lyc denotes the logit w.r.t the target label yc .
We propose a top-k loss as an improvement in the maxmargin loss by replacing the hard max with top-k maxes,
to make full use of the soft label provided by the target
classifier for more discriminative reconstruction. This encourages the discovery of the most representative sample while
simultaneously distinguishing it from the other most similar k
classes, rather than solely emphasizing the most similar one.
Our improved top-k loss is shown as follows:
Ltop-k (x, yc , k) = −lyc (x) + maxk lj (x).

(7)

j̸=yc

Meanwhile, we find the p-reg loss proposed in [31] useful
in regularizing reconstructed images in the feature space
(i.e., penultimate layer activations of the classifier) for closer
feature distance. They derive the regularizing feature preg by
sampling from a feature distribution pre-computed from the
whole public dataset using the target classifier. In contrast, we
introduce prior knowledge of pseudo-labels to estimate the
feature centroid of each target label preg,yc , which now reads
2

Lp-reg (px , yc ) = ∥px − preg,yc ∥2 ,

(8)

where px refers to penultimate layer activations of the target
classifier w.r.t x. To sum up, the classification loss adopted in
our Diff-MI can be formulated as
Lcls = Ltop-k + αLp-reg ,
where α is a regularization coefficient.

IV. E XPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate our Diff-MI in terms of the
performance of reconstructing private images from a specific
target classifier. The baselines we compare against are GMI
[1], KED-MI [2], and PLG-MI [3], which are all GAN-based
methods. We also include more comparisons with VMI [15]
and PPA [8], which prioritize fidelity but fall short in accuracy.

the distributional shift setting, our access is restricted to any
part of the original dataset, including its disjoint counterpart.
Consequently, we can only resort to another dataset of the
same data type, which exhibits a larger distributional shift with
Dpri . Herein, we use FFHQ and FaceScrub as substitutes for
Dpub .
B. Evaluation Metrics

A. Experimental Setup
To ensure a fair comparison, we maintain the same experimental setup for these baselines. Subsequently, we illustrate
the details of these setups.
Datasets. We perform MIAs for various classification tasks,
including face recognition, fine-grained image classification,
and disease prediction. For face recognition, we select three
widely-used datasets for experiments: (1) CelebA [9] containing 202,599 face images of 10,177 identities with coarse
alignment; (2) FFHQ [32] containing 70,000 high-quality
images with considerable variation in terms of age, ethnicity,
and image background; and (3) FaceScrub [33] containing
106,863 face image URLs of 530 celebrities. Herein, we use
a cleaned and aligned version of FaceScrub [34] which
includes 91,712 images of 263 males and 263 females because
of partially invalid URLs in the original dataset. For finegrained image classification, we choose CUB-200-2011
[35] which is the most widely-used dataset for fine-grained
visual categorization tasks. It contains 11,788 images of
200 subcategories belonging to birds. For disease prediction,
ChestX-Ray [36] is a medical image dataset that comprises
112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients
with the text-mined fourteen common disease labels, mined
from the text radiological reports via NLP techniques. And
CheXpert [37] contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240
patients with both frontal and lateral views available.
Target Classifiers. Following previous works, we evaluate
our attack on three different face recognition models with varying complexities: (1) VGG16 [38], (2) ResNet-152 (IR152)
[39], and (3) Face.evoLVe [10]. Before training the classifier,
the private dataset containing 30,027 images of CelebA is
split into two parts: 90% of the samples for training and 10%
for testing. All target classifiers are trained using the SGD
optimizer with learning rate 10−2 , batch size 64, momentum
0.9, and weight decay 10−4 while making use of pretrained
weights. All private images are cropped at the center, resized
to 64 × 64, and horizontally flipped in 50% of the cases.
Implementation Details. We implement our attack in both
standard and distributional shift settings. In the standard setting, we divide the original dataset into two disjoint parts: one
serves as Dpri to train the target classifier and the other serves
as Dpub to train the diffusion model, ensuring there is no image
and identity intersection between the two parts. Specifically,
we take 30,027 images of 1,000 identities from CelebA as
Dpri to train the target classifier and randomly choose 30,000
images of other identities from the disjoint part as Dpub to train
the diffusion model. However, the standard setting can be too
easy for the current SOTA method [3], thus a more challenging
but realistic scenario should be emphasized and researched. In

The evaluation of MIAs can be multifaceted, with the core
aim of assessing whether the reconstructed images expose any
private information about the target class. We reconstruct 5
images for the first 300 target labels for evaluation. Moreover,
we conduct a user study to access generative fidelity and
accuracy from the perspective of human preference. Herein,
we introduce metrics to meet the needs of visual inspection
as well as quantitative evaluation:
(1) Attack Accuracy (Acc). We build an evaluation classifier to predict target classes of the reconstruction and then
calculate top-1 (Acc1) and top-5 (Acc5) accuracies. Notably,
the evaluation classifier should be different from the target
classifier, as reconstructed images may incorporate visually
irrelevant and semantically meaningless features, potentially
leading to overfitting and inflated attack accuracy. Moreover,
the evaluation classifier should achieve high generalization
ability because it serves as a proxy for a human observer
in determining whether the reconstruction reveals personally
sensitive information. Herein, we adopt the model in [10],
which is pretrained on MS-Celeb-1M [41] and fine-tuned
on the same training data of the target classifier.
(2) Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). FID [42] is commonly used for evaluating the generative diversity and fidelity
in GAN’s works. It measures feature distances between generated images and real images. Feature vectors are all extracted
by an Inception-v3 model [43] pretrained on ImageNet [44].
In our experiment, we calculate FID between the reconstructed
images and the private training set of the target classifier
to reveal the generative fidelity of the reconstruction. Lower
FID typically indicates that the reconstructed images are
resembling the private images with superior generative fidelity.
In our implementation, we use Pytorch-FID [45].
(3) K-Nearest Neighbor Distance (KNN Dist). KNN Dist
means the shortest feature distance (ℓ2 distance) between the
reconstructed image for a specific target label and corresponding private images of the same class. Lower KNN Dist
typically indicates that the reconstructed images are closer to
the private images. Notably, KNN Dist is a model-specific
metric correlated with Acc and we found that previous works
[1], [2] with relatively lower Acc usually suffer from a much
higher KNN Dist, resulting in a misleading evaluation. To
achieve independence from Acc and precise evaluations, we
propose to only calculate KNN Dist on the reconstructed
images recognized successfully by the evaluation classifier to
have a fair comparison.
(4) PSNR, SSIM, & LPIPS [46]–[48] are three widely
used metrics in the field of image quality assessment. PSNR
measures the reconstruction accuracy of an image by comparing the peak signal-to-noise ratio between the reconstructed

and private images, with higher values indicating better image
quality. SSIM focuses on structural similarity, considering
aspects such as brightness, contrast, and structure, with values
ranging from -1 to 1, where closer to 1 indicates higher image
quality. LPIPS is a deep learning-based metric that assesses
image differences by learning the perceptual similarity of image patches, providing a more perceptually aligned evaluation,
which has been demonstrated to closely align with human
perception. We also introduce additional metrics regarding
image quality assessment, i.e., FSIM [49], VSI [50], HaarPSI
[51], SR-SIM [52], DSS [53], and MDSI [54].
Discussion on MIA Metrics. Notably, we would like
to distinguish between the attack accuracy (Acc) and other
metrics regarding reconstruction similarity (i.e., FID, KNN
Dist, and PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS). Acc relies on an evaluation
classifier and is inevitably subject to inherent prediction errors, which indicates that Acc may not always accurately
and objectively reflect the attack performance and largely
depends on the similarity between the evaluation and target
classifiers (e.g., model architecture, data augmentation, and
training strategy). In contrast, other metrics directly measure
the feature distance or image similarity to private images,
resulting in fewer cumulative errors and a more objective
assessment. Our user study also shows a preference for higherfidelity images, even if they achieve lower Acc. This implies
that once Acc is sufficiently high (e.g., when the user’s key
privacy is successfully reconstructed), the image quality becomes more crucial. This perspective prioritizes image quality
based on human observation over a purely numerical fit to the
classifier. This holistic consideration underscores the necessity
of compromising attack accuracy and generative fidelity, i.e.,

points in KNN Dist compared to the SOTA method (i.e., PLGMI), indicating that our reconstruction is closely resembling
the private images with improved generative fidelity and closer
feature distance. We also note that our improvement in fidelity
compromises attack accuracy compared to PLG-MI. Recall
that our intention is to strive for superior accuracy-fidelity
balance rather than solely pursuing high Acc. The improved fidelity is deemed more favorable when maintaining competitive
Acc. Fig. 3 visualizes the reconstructed images using different
methods. Compared with KED-MI and PLG-MI, which are
suffering from inferior generative fidelity because of GAN’s
inherent flaws and the fidelity degradation problem discussed
in Sec. I, our reconstruction exhibits more pronounced semantic facial features and demonstrates superior visual fidelity.
We also compare the reconstruction using our method without
fine-tuning (Ours w/o FT). The comparison indicates that our
FT method effectively preserves the generative fidelity while

improving attack accuracy.
Distributional Shift Setting. We further explore a more
challenging yet realistic scenario where the public and private datasets exhibit larger distributional shifts. As shown
in Table II, our Diff-MI outperforms all baselines in terms
of generative fidelity as well and simultaneously achieves
competitive attack accuracy against the SOTA method on both
public datasets. It is evident that all methods suffer from a
performance drop because of larger distributional shifts. Even
so, our reconstruction still exhibits lower FID and KNN Dist
with an average decrease of 20% and an average reduction of
20 points, respectively.
Reconstruction Quality. In addition to attack accuracy
(Acc) and distributional distance (FID and KNN Dist), we also
compare the image quality of different reconstructions to provide a more comprehensive assessment of attack performance.
As shown in Table III, our reconstructions outperform all base-

lines across all metrics in both settings. This indicates that our
reconstruction is not merely a simple numerical approximation
to the target classifier with high attack accuracy. Instead, it
involves simultaneous exploration of private data at both pixel
and feature levels, ensuring both accurate reconstruction and
superior image quality. These metrics assess the similarity
between reconstructed images and their corresponding private
counterparts from various feature perspectives. This indicates
that, in terms of reconstruction quality, our method is superior
in both accuracy and fidelity. Whether at the pixel level or
feature level, our method can more accurately and robustly
reconstruct private features. This result also corroborates our
discussion in Sec. IV-B. Although our method falls short
in attack accuracy (Acc) compared with PLG-MI, it excels
in terms of image similarity and quality (FID, KNN Dist,
and PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS). This suggests that our method is
not simply numerical fitting the target classifier but rather
reconstructing privacy features more effectively from a human
observation.
Comparisons with VMI and PPA. PPA introduces a plugand-play MIA method and adopts a GAN pretrained on the
public dataset. It intentionally relaxes the dependency between
the target model and image prior, enabling the use of a single
GAN to attack a wide range of target models. As shown
in Table IV, PPA suffers from low attack accuracy (Acc)
and diminished reconstruction similarity (PSNR, SSIM, FSIM,
etc.), even though it exhibits a decent FID. We argue that
such an attack is suboptimal, as its lack of precision impedes
the accurate reconstruction of user privacy, even coupled with
respectable generative fidelity. This can be attributed to its
plug-and-play attack paradigm, as its emphasis on attack
convenience inherently affects the attack performance when
applied to different target classifiers. In contrast, our Diff-

MI purposely learns a target-specific generator (i.e., CDM) to
approximate the target knowledge, resulting in improved and
robust attack performance. Although training such a targetspecific generator comes with additional costs, we believe that
these sacrifices are worthwhile in robustly achieving superior
attack performance. VMI formulates the MIA problem as a
variational inference problem, and provides a framework using
deep normalizing flows [16]. This framework alleviates the
fidelity degradation problem by incorporating a regularization
term (i.e., KL divergence) into the distribution of GAN’s latent
space. As shown in Table V, our Diff-MI outperforms VMI
across nearly all metrics. This superiority can be attributed
to our proposed target-specific CDM, which not only ensures
generative fidelity but also achieves more precise reconstruction.
High Resolution. We conduct our Diff-MI in highresolution scenarios following PPA’s [8] setup. We follow
the same experimental setup as PPA [8], the first work to
extend MIAs to high-resolution scenarios. Specifically, we
introduce CelebA as Dpri and align images using the HD
CelebA Cropper [55]. We crop images using a face factor of
0.65 and resize them to 224 × 224 with bicubic interpolation
(other parameters are set as default). Then following PPA, we
take the first 1,000 classes with the most number of samples
out of total 10,177 classes to train the target classifier T
= IR152 [39]. Meanwhile, we use the same training data
(Dpri = CelebA) to train an Inception-v3 model [43] as the
evaluation classifier. Training details are the same as PPA
without any modification using their official code. During
the attack stage, we re-implement PPA following its default
configuration and reconstruct 50 images for the first 100 target
classes for evaluation. As for our Diff-MI, we introduce LDM
[12], which can encode input images from 256 × 256 into
64×64 for computational efficiency, to train the target-specific
CDM with Dpub = FFHQ in the latent space. As shown
in Table VI, our method can achieve better attack accuracy
with competitive generative fidelity. This can be attributed to
our target-specific generator compared to PPA’s utilization of
pretrained StyleGAN2 [56]. Although training such a targetspecific generator comes with additional costs, we believe
these sacrifices are worthwhile in robustly achieving superior

MIAs with Defenses. To defend against MIAs, [57] has
proposed to employ a unilateral dependency optimization
strategy to minimize the dependency between inputs and
outputs during training the target model. Subsequently, [58]
enhanced this approach by introducing a bilateral dependency
optimization (BiDO) strategy and achieved SOTA performance
in defending MIAs. The BiDO strategy aims to minimize the
dependency between the latent representations and the inputs
while maximizing the dependency between latent representations and the outputs. Hence, we conduct an experiment to
assess the attack performance of our Diff-MI with defenses
(i.e., BiDO), particularly focusing on its performance in terms
of generative quality. As shown in Table VII, there is an
evident decrease in Acc (i.e., 93.47% → 81.00%), along
with a slight decline in the reconstruction quality (e.g., FID:
23.82 → 27.58). Even so, our reconstruction quality still
surpasses that of other baselines (i.e., FID, PSNR, SSIM,
FSIM, etc.), demonstrating the robustness of our Diff-MI in
reconstructing high-quality private images.
D. Comparisons on Other Datasets
In addition to the face recognition task, we also conduct
MIAs on other classification tasks, including fine-grained
image classification on CUB-200-2011 [35] and disease
prediction on ChestX-Ray [36] and CheXpert [37].
Experimental Details. For CUB-200-2011, we use the
officially provided bounding-box annotations to crop each
sample in advance. Among all 200 classes, we designate
the first 50 classes containing 2,889 images as the private

For ChestX-Ray, we randomly select 2,000 images from

particular class is less than 2,000, we include all the images
of that class, resulting in a total of 25,344 images as the

for ChestX-Ray. α for the p-reg loss is set to 1.0 as well. In
step-1, we first pretrain the CDM with batch size 150 for 50K
iterations on two A40 GPUs and then fine-tune the pretrained
CDM for all target classes, conducting a total of 400 epochs
for both CUB-200-2011 and for ChestX-Ray. In step-2,
we follow the same setup of the face recognition task and
reconstruct 10 and 100 images per class for CUB-200-2011
and ChestX-Ray for quantitative evaluation.
Experimental Results. As shown in Table IX, our method
demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics on CUB-200-2011. This indicates that quantitatively,
our reconstruction outperforms all baselines in terms of both
attack accuracy and generative fidelity, two critical factors

in assessing the attack performance of MIAs. Our method
achieves an impressive FID reduction of over 50% compared
to all baselines. This substantial improvement signifies our
ability to generate images of exceptional fidelity that closely
resemble real examples from the dataset. Notably, our DiffMI, which is based on diffusion models, requires minimal
hyperparameter tuning when generalizing to new datasets,
while previous GAN-based baselines were highly sensitive to
hyperparameter selection. This sensitivity necessitates additional hyperparameter tuning when attempting to generalize
them to new datasets. The reconstructed images obtained
by PLG-MI and our Diff-MI are visualized in Fig. 4. The
visualization clearly demonstrates that our reconstruction effectively captures intricate details of various bird species, including beak shapes, wing coloration, and tail length. Whereas
PLG-MI exhibits a ringing-like effect due to its sensitivity
to hyperparameters, resulting in a degradation of generative
fidelity. Conclusively, our method not only achieves superior
generative fidelity but also accurately captures the semantic
information of private images.
Table IX presents the results of performing MIAs on the
private medical dataset ChestX-Ray, taking ChestX-Ray
and CheXpert as the public dataset, respectively. Compared
to all baselines, our method achieves nearly the best performance across all metrics, with only a slight increase in KNN
Dist. Particularly noteworthy is our substantial improvement
in generative fidelity, as evidenced by an average decrease of
45% in FID. This significant reduction in FID highlights the
enhanced realism and fidelity of the reconstructed samples,
indicating the superiority of our Diff-MI over SOTA methods
in MIAs. These compelling results pave the way for broader
applications of our method in various domains where highquality MIAs are essential. We also provide a visual comparison of the private images reconstructed by baselines and our
method using CheXpert as the public dataset, as shown in
Fig. 5.
E. Human Preference Study
We conduct a human preference study using Amazon Mechanical Turk. We perform a paired test of our method with
three baselines and Ours (w/o FT). For generative fidelity, we

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021

display two reconstructed images from each method (ours v.s.
baseline) with the question - “Which image do you consider
to be more realistic?”. For attack accuracy, we display three
target images of the same class from Dpri , along with the
paired reconstructed images, and ask - “Which image do
you consider to be more similar to the target images?”. As
shown in Table VIII, our reconstruction is preferred (≥ 50%)
over all baselines in terms of both generative fidelity and
attack accuracy. Workers inevitably lean to images with higher
fidelity when discerning more similar images. Therefore, compared with Ours (w/o FT), our method falls short in both
aspects. Attackers can choose whether to fine-tune depending
on superior human preference or better attack performance.
F. Ablation Study
We first compare the impact of fine-tuning different layers
in the middle block, considering various change rates. Results
in Fig. 6 (b) indicate that fine-tuning fewer layers yields
superior attack performance. Specifically, among all layers in
the middle block, only fine-tuning the top-3 layers achieves
the highest Acc and lowest FID but suffers from a long
time for convergence. Thus we choose to fine-tune the top-5
layers in our implementation. Fig. 6 (c) shows the top-k loss
improves the attack performance and k = 20 is optimal for
the lowest FID. Increasing k (e.g. 30, 40) leads to higher Acc
but inferior fidelity proved by the increasing FID, meaning
that the reconstruction starts to incorporate some semantically
meaningless features that overfit the target classifier. Fig. 6 (d)
illustrates the p-reg loss serves as a beneficial regularization
term for improving generative fidelity (α = 1.0), albeit with
a slight decrease in Acc. Conclusively, k and α are set to 20
and 1.0, striking a trade-off between Acc and FID.
We further ablate certain key components in Diff-MI and
derive the following conclusions from Table X: (1) The PGD
method significantly enhances attack performance in terms of
both attack accuracy and generative fidelity, owing to its comprehensive utilization of the target classifier; (2) Our improved
loss function demonstrates superior performance compared to
the CE loss and max-margin loss employed in previous studies.
This indicates that our method can accurately reconstruct more
discriminative images in MIAs; (3) Our target-specific CDM
effectively captures the knowledge of the target classifier,
resulting in higher Acc and closer feature distance. However,
it does encounter a trade-off between generative fidelity and
attack accuracy during the fine-tuning process. Attackers can
choose whether to fine-tune the pretrained generator based
on their specific requirements, prioritizing either higher attack
accuracy or improved generative fidelity.
V. C ONCLUSION
This paper has presented a two-step diffusion-based whitebox MIA method, namely Diff-MI. In step-1, we customize a
target-specific CDM to distill the target classifier’s knowledge
and approximate its private distribution under a pretrain-thenfinetune fashion, achieving superior accuracy-fidelity balance.
In step-2, we introduce an iterative image reconstruction
method to involve both diffusion priors and target classifier’s

11

knowledge through a combinatorial optimization problem.
Additionally, we introduce an improved max-margin loss for
MIAs, optimizing the use of feature information and soft
labels from the target classifier with better attack performance. Experiments show that our method achieves SOTA
generative fidelity and reconstruction quality with competitive
attack accuracy in diverse scenarios across different model
architectures.
Limitation. To enhance the robustness and overall attack
performance in MIAs, our method requires training a targetspecific CDM from scratch, incurring more computational
costs. Additionally, our Diff-MI still suffers from a trade-off
between generative fidelity and attack accuracy during finetuning and attacking. For future work, we intend to explore
the potential of pretrained diffusion models with enhanced
generative quality and attack accuracy in both white-box and
black-box MIAs.
Ethical Statement. MIAs can have profound impacts on
society as they pose a serious threat to individual privacy
and data security, eroding public trust in artificial intelligence
systems and hindering technology adoption in critical applications. Meanwhile, diffusion models are gaining popularity
in the field of image synthesis, whereas they can also be
employed by malicious attackers for conducting generative
MIAs and reconstructing high-quality private images about
users. While our Diff-MI could potentially have negative
societal impacts, we intend to reveal the vulnerabilities of
current systems and raise public awareness about privacy
attacks on DNNs. We believe that our work will inspire the
design of defenses against MIAs.
Data Availability. In our experiments, we simulate the realworld attack scenario by introducing CelebA1 [9], FFHQ2
[32], and FaceScrub3 [33] as the private and public datasets
to inverse face recognition classifiers. Meanwhile, we also
compare other plausible scenarios, such as fine-grained image
classification and disease detection, where CUB-200-20114
[35], ChestX-Ray5 [36], and CheXpert6 [37] are introduced. More details about datasets, models, and codes of this
paper are available in our GitHub repository7 .
